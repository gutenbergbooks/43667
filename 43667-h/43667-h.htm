<h2>
EDITOR'S GENERAL PREFACE.
</h2>


<p>
This series of source-books aims at providing illustrations of various
aspects of English history at a price that will enable the teacher to
place them in the hands of the pupils themselves. All teachers of
history are agreed as to the value of using the "original documents" in
their work as a means of making their pupils realise that they are
studying human life in past ages, but hitherto the consideration of
price has confined the use of them almost entirely to the teachers
themselves. In the series here prepared for the use of scholars and
teachers alike the volumes are each devoted to one aspect of history,
so that the teacher can select that one which will illustrate the
particular line taken. Thus, one will be on "Markets and Fairs," for
use when the teaching has an economic basis, another will deal with
political events, and another with the social side of history. Great
care has been taken to secure extracts from contemporary and reliable
authorities.

<h2>
<a name="intro">&nbsp;</a>
INTRODUCTION
</h2>


<p>
Fairs and markets are not different institutions&#8212;a fair is a market of
a particular kind, an important market held not once or several times a
week, but once or several times a year. The customs, the rights, and
the law of markets are therefore relevant to fairs; and generalisations
as to markets apply to fairs.
</p>

<p>
There is no direct evidence as to the origin of markets and fairs in
England. Early Oriental and classical literature indicate that they
have served all peoples whose development has reached a certain stage.
As communities cease to be entirely self-supporting trade arises
naturally; and trade is obviously facilitated by a concentration in
particular places at particular times of sellers and buyers. Certain of
these gatherings had in the ninth century already been regularised in
England as markets. The king or other lord had become responsible for
the validity of sales in them, and suffered them to take place within
the territory over which he had power. In return he received from the
market people tolls, fines for transgressions, and other dues, which
were a considerable source of profit, sufficient to make the tenancy of
a market an object of desire. It was frequently acquired by a religious
house.
</p>

<p>
It is noteworthy that the king was regarded as the original holder of
all market right in England. The lord who had a market on his manor,
whether in virtue of a royal charter or by force of a custom of which
the beginning had been forgotten, was considered to exercise a right
which initially had been derived from the king. In historic times the
establishment of new markets has been, until recently, only possible by
means of a royal grant.

ANGLO-SAXON MARKETS.
</h2>


<p>
873-99. <i>Grant to the church of St. Peter, Worcester, of half the
rights of Worcester Market.</i>
</p>

<p>
To Almighty God, true Unity and holy Trinity in heaven, be praise and
glory and rendering of thanks, for all his benefits bestowed upon us.
Firstly for whose love and for St. Peter's and the church at Worcester,
and at the request of Werfrith the bishop, their friend, Aethelraed the
ealdorman, and Aethelflaed commanded the burh at Worcester to be built,
and eke God's praise to be there upraised. And now they make known by
this charter that of all the rights which appertain to their lordship,
both in market and in street, within the byrg and without, they grant
half to God and St. Peter and the lord of the church; that those who
are in the place may be the better provided, that they may thereby in
some sort easier aid the brotherhood, and that this remembrance may be
the firmer kept in mind, in the place, as long as God's service is done
within the minster. And Werfrith, the bishop, and his flock have
appointed this service before the daily one, both during their lives
and after, to sing at matins, vespers, and undernsong the psalm <i>De
Profundis</i>, during their lives, and after their death <i>Laudate
Dominum</i>; and a mass for them whether alive or dead. Aethelraed and
Aethelflaed proclaim that they have thus granted with goodwill to God
and St. Peter, under witness of Aelfred the king and all the witan in
Mercia; &#8230; as for &#8230; wohc&#233;apung,<a href="#note1" name="noteref1"><small>[1]</small></a>  and all the customs from which
any fine may arise, let the lord of the church have half of it, for
God's sake and St. Peter's, as it was arranged about the markets and
the streets; and without the market-place let the bishop enjoy his
rights, as of old our predecessors decreed and privileged. Aethelread
and Aethelflaed did this by witness of Aelfred the king, and by witness
of those witan of the Mercians whose names stand written hereafter, and
in the name of God Almighty they abjure all their successors never to
diminish these alms which they have granted to the church for God's
love and St. Peter's.

904. <i>Grant by Edward of Wessex, son of King Alfred, to the church of
Winchester of Taunton Market.</i>
</p>

<p>
I Edward, who by divine and indulgent clemency am king of the Anglo-Saxons,
&#8230; consent of my magnates whose names are written below, &#8230; grant for
ever the market of the town of Taunton, which in English is called
<i>thaes tunes cyping</i>, &#8230; to the holy church of God in the city
of Winchester, &#8230; without limitation or impediment and with all
easements.<a href="#note2" name="noteref2"><small>[2]</small></a>

968. <i>Confirmation of Edward's grant by Edgar.</i>
</p>

<p>
Here is made known in this writing how King Edgar renewed the liberty
of Taunton, for the Holy Trinity and St. Peter and St. Paul, to the
episcopal see of Winchester, as King Edward had before freed it, &#8230;;
and let the town's market and the produce of the town-dues go to the
holy place, as they did before, in the days of my forefathers, and were
levied for Bishop Aelfeah and every one of those who enjoyed the land.
Whoever will increase this liberty, may God increase his prosperity in
a long life here and in eternity. But if any, through audacity and the
instigation of the devil and his limbs, will violate this liberty or
pervert it to another, unless ere his departure hence he make
reparation, be he with malediction cut off from the communion of our
Lord and all his saints, and ever be tormented in hell torture, with
Judas who was Christ's betrayer.

<i>N.B.&#8212;These latter enactments were chiefly distinguished by their
breach, for throughout the middle ages English markets were frequently
held on Sunday. They were probably abortive attempts on the part of
pious legislators to end a custom which seemed to them ungodly.</i>

<a name="effect">&nbsp;</a>
EFFECT OF THE CONQUEST.
</h2>


<p>
In Domesday Book there is evidence of a considerable number of markets
which had existed in England under Edward the Confessor, and which
usually yielded to their holders an annual profit of from 20s. to 40s.,
in those days large sums of money. New markets were in some cases
established by the Norman lords who acquired English lands, and they
tended to disorganise the market economy.
</p>


<p class="toppad">
1087. <i>The ruin of the bishop's market at St. Germans.</i>
</p>

<p>
The bishop has a lordship called St. Germans. In that lordship, on the
day on which King Edward lived and died, there was a market held on
Sunday. And now it is made nothing by the market set up close at hand
by the count of Mortain in his castle, on the same day.
</p>

<p class="right">
<cite>Exon. Domesday</cite> (Rec. Com.), 182, 470.
</p>


<p class="toppad">
1087. <i>Necessity to change the day of the market at Hoxne in
Suffolk.</i>
</p>

<p>
Ailmarus, the bishop, held Hoxne in the time of King Edward&#8230;. In this
manor there was a market in the time of King Edward and afterwards.
William the king came, and the market was held on Sunday. And William
Malet made his castle at Eye; and on the same day on which there was a
market in the bishop's manor, William Malet made another market in his
castle, and that so much to the detriment of the bishop's market that
this was of little worth. Now therefore it is held on Friday, but the
market of Eye still takes place on Sunday.
</p>

<p class="right">
<cite>Domesday</cite> (Rec. Com.), II. 379.
</p>


<p class="toppad">
1087. <i>Abolition of Launceston Market.</i>
</p>

<p>
The canons of St. Stephen hold Launceston. Thence the count of Mortain
has now taken a market, which was situated there in the days of King
Edward, and which was worth 20s.
</p>

<p class="right">
<cite>Domesday</cite> (Rec. Com.), I. 120b.
</p>


<p class="toppad">
It appears always to have been the intention of the Government that
markets and fairs should be held only in the stronger places of the
country, where the just and peaceful transaction of business could be
secured. Such a situation was in the later middle ages the rule, but
that in an early period it was not universal appears from the existence
of legislation on the subject.
</p>


<p class="toppad">
1066-87. <i>Law of William the Conqueror.</i>
</p>

<p>
We forbid that any market or fair be held or suffered except in the
cities of our realm and in the walled boroughs and in castles and in
the safest places, where the customs of our realm, and our common
right, and the dues of our crown, which were constituted by our good
predecessors, cannot suffer loss nor fraud nor violation; for we will
that all things be done with right forms and openly, and in accordance
with judgment and with justice.

MARKET-PLACES.

<p>
Markets and fairs were held sometimes in open and outlying places, as
at Smithfield; but more frequently in central parts of their towns&#8212;in
graveyards, in the market-places of which many survive, and in the
streets. The last case has named streets in many English towns "Cheap"
or "Cheapside," for "cheap" meant "market."

SMITHFIELD HORSE AND CATTLE MARKET UNDER HENRY II.
</h2>


<p>
Outside one of the gates there (in London), immediately in the suburb,
is a certain field, smooth (Smith) field in fact and name. Every
Friday, unless it be a higher day of appointed solemnity, there is in
it a famous show of noble horses for sale. Earls, barons, and many
citizens who are in town, come to see or buy. It is pleasant to see the
steppers in quick trot going gently up and down, their feet on each
side alternately rising and falling. On this side are the horses most
fit for esquires, moving with harder pace yet swiftly, that lift and
set down together, as it were, the opposite fore and hind feet; on that
side colts of fine breed who, not yet well used to the bit,
</p>

<p class="ctr">
"Altius incedunt, et mollia crura reponunt."<a href="#note4" name="noteref4"><small>[4]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
In that part are the sumpter horses, powerful and spirited; here costly
chargers elegant of form, noble of stature, with ears quickly
tremulous, necks lifted, haunches plump. In their stepping the buyers
first try for the gentler, then for the quicker pace, which is by the
fore and the hind feet moving in pairs together. When a race is ready
for such thunderers, and perhaps for others of like kind, powerful to
carry, quick to run, a shout is raised, orders are given that the
common horses stand apart. The boys who mount the wing-footed, by twos
or threes, according to the match, prepare themselves for contest;
skilled to rule horses, they restrain the mouths of the untrained with
bitted bridles. For this chiefly they care, that no one should get
before another in the course. The horses rise too in their own way to
the struggle of the race; their limbs tremble, impatient of delay they
cannot keep still in their place; at the sign given their limbs are
stretched, they hurry on their course, are borne with stubborn speed.
The riders contend for the love of praise and hope of victory, plunge
spurs into the loose-reined horses, and urge them none the less with
whips and shouts. You would think with Heraclitus everything to be in
motion, and the opinion to be wholly false of Zeno, who said that there
was no motion and no goal to be reached. In another part of the field
stand by themselves the goods proper to rustics, implements of
husbandry, swine with long flanks, cows with full udders, oxen of bulk
immense, and woolly flocks. There stand the mares fit for plough, dray
and cart, some big with foal, and others with their young colts closely
following.

PIED POUDRE COURTS.
</h2>


<p>
The term "Pied Poudre" or "Pie Poudre" is generally held to be derived
from the French <i lang="fr">pieds poudr&#233;s</i>, that is, dusty feet, and perhaps
arose from the fact that the courts so called were frequented by
chapmen with dusty feet, or less probably from the celerity of the
judgments which were pronounced while the dust was on the feet of the
litigants. The existence of such courts, in connection with fairs, was
common to England and the continent. It is possible that in some cases
and in an early period the business of fairs was not transacted in a
special court. On the other hand, the distinctive feature of Pied
Poudre Courts, the method of trial by the persons best qualified to
judge, the merchants, was akin to the spirit of English law. Therefore
it is probable that they were very early introduced into England.
</p>


<p class="ctrtoppad">
<i>Definition of Pied Poudre Courts.</i>
</p>

<p>
Divers fairs be holden and kept in this realm, some by prescription
allowed before justices in eyre, and some by the grant of our lord the
king that now is, and some by the grant of his progenitors and
predecessors;
</p>

<p>
And to every of the same fairs is of right pertaining courts of
pipowders, to minister in the same due justice in his behalf;
</p>

<p>
In which court it hath been all times accustomed, that every person
coming to the same fairs, should have lawful remedy of all manner of
contracts, trespasses, covenants, debts, and other deeds made or done
within any of the same fair, and within the jurisdiction of the same,
and to be tried by merchants being of the same fair.

With regard to the claim of the said barons to have at Yarmouth royal

for forty days, they are to have the keeping of the king's peace and to
do royal justice, namely during the fair they are to have four
serjeants, of whom one shall carry the king's banner, and another sound
a horn to assemble the people and to be better heard, and two shall
carry wands for keeping the king's peace, and this office they shall do
on horse-back if they so wish. The bailiffs of the Ports together with
the provost of Yarmouth are to make attachments and plead pleas and
determine plaints during the fair, according to law merchant, and the
amercements and the profits of the people of the Ports are to remain to
the barons of the Ports, at the time of the fair, and the profits and
amercements of all others who are not of the Ports to remain to the
king by the bailiffs of Yarmouth. The aforesaid bailiffs of the barons
of the Ports together with the provost of Yarmouth are to have the
keeping of the prison of Yarmouth during the fair, and if any prisoner
be taken for so grave a trespass that it cannot be determined by them
in time of fair, by merchant law, nor the prisons delivered, such
persons to remain in the prison of Yarmouth until the coming of the

1417. A Court of our Lord the King, holden before Henry Bartone, Mayor,
and the Aldermen, in the Guild-hall of London, on Tuesday, the 16th day
of February&#8230;.
</p>

<p>
William Redhede of Barnet was taken and attached, for that when one
Hugh Morys, maltman, on Monday the 15th day of February, &#8230; brought
here to the city of London four bushels of wheat, and exposed them for
sale in common and open market, at the market of Graschurch
(Gracechurch) in the parish of St. Benedict Graschurch in the city
aforesaid, the said William there falsely and fraudulently pretended
that he was a taker and purveyor of such victuals, as well for the
household of our said lord the king as for the victualling of his town
of Harfleur; and so, under feigned colour of his alleged office, would
have had the wheat aforesaid taken and carried away, had he not been
warily prevented from so doing by the constables and reputable men of
the parish aforesaid, and other persons then in the market; in contempt
of our lord the king, and to the grievous loss and in deceit of the
commonalty of the city aforesaid; and especially of the said market and
of other markets in the city, seeing that poor persons, who bring wheat
and other victuals to the city aforesaid, do not dare to come, by land
or by water, through fear of the multitude of pretended purveyors and
takers who resort thither from every side.
</p>

<p>
&#8230; And thereupon, by the said mayor and aldermen, to the end that
others might in future have a dread of committing such crimes, it was
adjudged that the same William Redhede should, upon the three market
days then next ensuing, be taken each day from the prison of Newgate to
the market called Le Cornmarket opposite to the Friars Minors
(Greyfriars, whose house was on the site of Christ's Hospital), and
there the course of the judgement aforesaid was to be proclaimed; and
after that he was to be taken through the middle of the high street of
Cheap to the pillory on Cornhill, and upon that he was to be placed on
each of those three days, there to stand for one hour each day, the
reason for such sentence being then and there publicly proclaimed. And
after that he was to be taken from thence through the middle of the
high street of Cornhill to the market of Graschurch aforesaid, where
like proclamation was to be made, and from thence back again to prison.

in Westchepe (Cheapside), and Cornhulle (Cornhill) in London, on
Thursday the 20th day of March in the 16th year.

<p>
As from of old it has been the custom to hold in the city on every
feastday two markets, called <i>Evechepynges</i>, one in Westchepe and
the other on Cornhulle; that is to say the one in Westchepe between the
corner of the lane called St. Lawrence Lane and a house called the
Cage. So always that the said lane be not obstructed by the people of
the said market, who are not to stand near to the shops there for the
sale of divers wares that in such shops are wont to be sold. And that
too by daylight only, between the first bell rung and the second, for
the said markets ordained. And now on the 10th day of March &#8230; William
Staundone, the mayor, and the aldermen of the said city, have been
given to understand that divers persons at night and by candlelight do
sell in the common hostels there and in other places, in secret, divers
wares that have been larcenously pilfered and some falsely wrought and
some that are old as being new; and that other persons do there
practise the sin of harlotry, under colour of the sale of their said
wares, to the very great damage and scandal of good and honest folks of
the said city.

Therefore the said mayor and aldermen by wise counsel and with good
deliberation between them had, for the honour of the city and in order
to put the said markets under good control and governance, have
ordained that from henceforth on every such market night each of the
said two bells shall be rung by the beadle of the ward where it is
hung, one hour before sunset and then again half an hour after sunset.
At which second ringing all the people shall depart from the market
with their wares, on pain of forfeiture to the chamber of all such
wares as shall, after the second bell rung, be found in the same; as to
the which the beadle if he be acting, or officer by the chamber of the
Guildhall thereunto assigned, shall have twopence in every shilling for
his trouble in taking them. And that no one shall sell in common
hostels any wares that in the said market are wont to be sold, or
anywhere else within the said city or in the suburbs thereof, but only
in their own shops and in the places and at the days and hours
aforesaid, on pain of forfeiture to the use of the said chamber of all

weights and quality of all foodstuffs and of all things which belong to
clothing, and to observe the statutes and ordinances issued in this

prices greatly flourish, the clerk should summon to his aid the
presidents of colleges and such others of the university as he knows to
be fit for the business, and should consult with them as to what course
can be taken to render the prices lower.

arms, wherefore they have prayed the king to provide a remedy. The king
therefore orders the bailiffs to release the said John and Thomas and
goods, upon their finding surety to have them before the king in three
weeks from Michaelmas.

<i>Misadventure of some Shrewsbury Merchants travelling to a Fair.</i>
</p>


<p>
1332. <span class="sc">To Richard Earl of Arundel.</span>
</p>

<p>
Whereas the king lately took into his protection the burgesses of
Shrewsbury so that they might be free to intend their affairs and to
exercise their merchandise more safely, forbidding any to do them harm;
and they have shewn to the king that whereas John de Weston, Richard
Biget, William son of Roger de Wythiford, and John son of Yarvord le
Walssh, their fellow burgesses, lately wished to go to the town of La
Pole (Welshpool) in Wales to a fair there, to ply their merchandise,
Yevan ap Griffith, the earl's yeoman, with other armed Welshmen of the
earl, took without cause the said John, Richard, William and John, at
Cause in the Welsh marches, without the earl's lordship, as they were
going to La Pole, and took them with their horses and other goods and
chattels, to the value of &#163;200, and brought them to the earl's castle
of Osewaldestre (Oswestry), where they imprisoned them and where they
are still detained. And although the burgesses have repeatedly
requested the earl to deliver the aforesaid men and to restore their
said goods and chattels, the earl has neglected to do anything in the
matter; wherefore the burgesses have besought the king to provide a
remedy. The king therefore orders the earl to deliver from prison the
said John, Richard, William and John without delay and to restore to
them their horses, goods and chattels, or, if there be any reasonable
cause why he should not do this, to be before the king and his council
at the octaves of Holy Trinity to inform the king.

DEGENERATION OF FAIRS.
</h2>


<p>
In the seventeenth century and afterwards, certain fairs, notably those
in and near London, had come to be little more than places of
amusement, more or less disreputable.
</p>


<p class="ctrtoppad">
<i>Bartholomew Fair</i> (in 1641).
</p>

<p>
Bartholomew Fair begins on the twenty-fourth day of <i>August</i>, and
is then of so vast an extent that it is contained in no less than four
several parishes, namely Christ Church, Great and Little Saint
Bartholomews, and Saint Sepulchres. Hither resort people of all sorts,
High and Low, Rich and Poor, from cities, towns and countries; and of
all sects, Papists, Atheists, Anabaptists, and Brownists, and of all
conditions, good and bad, virtuous and vicious, Knaves and fools,
Rogues and Rascals.
</p>

<p>
And now that we may the better take an exact survey of the whole Fair,
first let us enter into Christ Church cloisters, which are now hung so
full of pictures that you would take that place, or rather mistake it,
for Saint <i>Peters</i> in <i>Rome</i>; only this is the difference,
those there are set up for worship, these here for sale&#8230;.
</p>

<p>
Let us now make a progress through Smithfield which is the heart of the
Fair, where in my heart I think there are more motions in a day to be
seen than are in a term in Westminster to be heard. But whilst you take
notice of the several motions there, take this caution along with you,
let one eye watch narrowly that no one's hand makes a motion in your
pocket, which is the next way to move you to impatience.
</p>

<p>
The Fair is full of gold and silver-drawers. Just as Lent is to the
Fishmonger so is Bartholomew Fair to the Pickpocket; it is his high
harvest which is never bad but when his cart goes up Holborn.<a href="#note16" name="noteref16"><small>[16]</small></a>  &#8230;
Some of your cutpurses are in fee with cheating costermongers, who have
a trick now and then to throw down a basket of refuse pears, which
prove cloak-pears to those that shall lose their hats and cloaks in
striving who shall gather fastest. They have many dainty baits to draw
a bit, and if you be not vigilant you shall hardly escape their nets.
Fine fowlers they are, for every finger of theirs is a lime twig with
which they catch dotterels.<a href="#note17" name="noteref17"><small>[17]</small></a>  They are excellently well read in
Physiognomy; for they will know how strong you are in the purse by
looking in your face, and for more certainty thereof they will follow
you close, and never leave you till you draw your purse, or they for
you, which they'll be sure to have if you look not to it though they
kiss Newgate for it.
</p>

<p>
It is remarkable and worthy your observation to behold and hear the
strange sights and confused noise in the Fair. Here a Knave in a fool's
coat with a trumpet sounding, or on a drum beating, invites you and
would fain persuade you to see his puppets. There a Rogue like a wild
woodman, or in an Antic-shape like an Incubus, desires your company to
view his motion; on the other side Hocus Pocus with three yards of tape
or ribbon in's hand, shewing his art of Legerdemain to the admiration
and astonishment of a company of cockloaches.<a href="#note18" name="noteref18"><small>[18]</small></a>  Amongst these you
shall see a gray goose-cap, as wise as the rest, with a "what do ye
lack" in his mouth, stand in his booth shaking a rattle or scraping on
a fiddle, with which children are so taken that they presently cry out
for these fopperies. And all these together make such a distracted
noise that you would think Babel were not comparable to it. Here there
are also your gamesters in action: some turning of a whimsey, others
throwing for Pewter, who can quickly dissolve a round shilling into a
three halfpenny saucer. Long lane at this time looks very fair and
puts out her best clothes with the wrong side outward, so turned for
their better turning off. And Cloth Fair is now in great request; well
fare the ale-houses there. Yet better may a man fare, but at a dearer
rate, in the pig-market, alias Pasty-nook or Pie-corner, where pigs are
all hours of the day on the stalls piping hot, and would cry, if they
could speak, "come eat me." &#8230; Unconscionable exactions, and excessive
inflammations of reckonings, made that corner of the Fair too hot for
my company; therefore I resolved by myself to steer my course another
way, and having once got out, not to come again in haste.

GREENWICH FAIR (in 1835-6).
</p>

<p>
&#8230; Imagine yourself in an extremely dense crowd which swings you to
and fro and in and out, and every way but the right one; add to this
the screams of women, the shouts of boys, the clanging of gongs, the
firing of pistols, the ringing of bells, the bellowing of
speaking-trumpets, the squeaking of penny dittoes, the noise of a dozen
bands with three drums in each, all playing different tunes at the same
time, the hallooing of showmen, and an occasional roar from the wild
beast shows; and you are in the very centre and heart of the fair.
</p>

<p>
This immense booth, with the large stage in front, so brightly
illuminated with variegated lamps and pots of burning fat, is
"Richardson's," where you have a melodrama (with three murders and a
ghost), a pantomime, a comic song, an overture, and some incidental
music, all done in five-and-twenty minutes. The company are now
promenading outside in all the dignity of wigs, spangles, red ochre,
and whitening&#8230;. The exhibitions next in popularity to these itinerant
theatres are the travelling menageries, or, to speak more intelligibly,
the "Wild beast shows," where a military band in beef-eater's costume,
with leopardskin caps, play incessantly, and where large highly
coloured representations of tigers tearing men's heads open, and a lion
being burnt with red hot irons to induce him to drop his victim, are
hung up outside, by way of attracting visitors.
</p>

<p>
&#8230; The grandest and most numerously frequented booth in the whole
fair however is "The Crown and Anchor," a temporary ballroom&#8212;we
forget how many feet long&#8212;the price of admission to which is one
shilling&#8230;. The dancing itself beggars description&#8212;every figure
lasts about an hour, and the ladies bounce up and down the middle
with a degree of spirit which is quite indescribable. As to the
gentlemen they stamp their feet upon the ground every time "hands
four round" begins, go down the middle and up again with cigars in
their mouths and silk handkerchiefs in their hands, and whirl their
partners round, nothing loth, scrambling and falling and knocking
up against the other couples, until they are fairly tired out and
can move no longer.
